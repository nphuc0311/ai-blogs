Genkit is an open-source framework from Google designed to streamline the development of AI-powered applications. Whether you're building a simple chatbot or a complex multi-modal system, Genkit provides the tools and structure you need to go from prototype to production quickly.

## What is Genkit?

Genkit helps you organize your AI logic into "flows," which are chains of steps that can include model calls, data processing, and external API interactions. It supports various models from providers like Google AI and is built to be extensible.

Key features include:
*   **Declarative Flows**: Define your application logic clearly.
*   **Developer UI**: Test and debug your flows locally.
*   **Observability**: Trace your flows to understand performance.
*   **Extensibility**: Integrate custom tools and models.

## Setting Up Your First Genkit Project

To start, you'll need Node.js installed. Create a new project and initialize Genkit:

```bash
npm create genkit@latest
```

This command will scaffold a new project with all the necessary configurations. You can then define a simple flow in a `index.ts` file:

```typescript
import { configureGenkit } from '@genkit-ai/core';
import { googleAI } from '@genkit-ai/googleai';

configureGenkit({
  plugins: [googleAI()],
  logLevel: 'debug',
  enableTracingAndMetrics: true,
});

export default {
  // Your flows will be exported here
};
```

Genkit makes it easy to add powerful AI capabilities to your applications while maintaining a structured and maintainable codebase. Dive in and start building!
